### Hi there 👋


**Arianna-Cicero/Arianna-Cicero** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on software development 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning literally everything that I can
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on whatever project you want me in, and even if I don't know about it, I'll learn it!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with finding a job in the programming area, is really difficult for a student to find a part-time (in the programming area)
- 💬 Ask me about anything that you want, I might be able to help you👍
- 📫 How to reach me: [Discord](https://discord.com/users/607265809793941514)
